The structure of this Project was changed to be in-line with the Exercise one for RestAPI.
Because of that, the URL also changed compared to the one in the Proj Spec Review list.

You can access it on:
http://c2-proj-image-filter-aleks.eu-west-1.elasticbeanstalk.comapi/v0/images/filteredimage?image_url=https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/kitten-report.jpg
  * the recommended photo was not reachable for myself, I tried with another one from my S3 bucket and it worked.
